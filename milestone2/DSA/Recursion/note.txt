recursion is function called itself;

for every recursion problem use PMI method 

3 step:

1. Base case: prove f(0) & f(1) is true.
2. Assume that already proved for small problem: Assume f(i) is true for all i <= k.
3. using that small problem asumption proved that big problem (and do the correctly coding): use "2" statement to prove f(k+1) is true.
