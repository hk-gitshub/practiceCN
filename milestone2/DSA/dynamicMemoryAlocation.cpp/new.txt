our data store in two types of memory. stack (statically) and heap (dynamically)

dynamic memory alocate using new keyword.

=> For int : 

it will be "new int". so 4 byte int memory made on heap.
and we store it's address in pointer which made on stack

syntax: int * p = new int;
        char *pc = new char;
        double *pd= new double;

for array: int *arr = new int[10];

            int n;
            cin>>n;
            int *arr = new int[n];
